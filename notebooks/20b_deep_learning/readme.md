# Deep Learning based mage segmentation

In this chaper, we will use deep learning based algorithms for image segmentation. 

## Installation of requirements

For using [cellpose](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/) and [stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), these dependencies must be installed:

```
pip install stardist numpy==1.21.5
pip install cellpose[all]
```

Mac users may have to execute the second command like this:
```
pip install "cellpose[all]"
```
