# Comparing segmentation algorithms

In this chapter we will introduce procedures for comaparing segmentation algorithms. We will use a simple scenario by applying the same algorithm differently implemented to one image. This is a simple use-case for academic purposes. For comparing algorithms in more general, multiple images should be processed and the results analysed.

## Installation of requirements

In this chapter we will use the [statsmodels library](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for statistical testing. You can install it using conda or pip:

```
conda install -c conda-forge statsmodels
```

```
pip install statsmodels
```
