# Simulating data
For exploring image processing algorithms and in particular for measuring how good they are in solving the tasks they were made for it make a lot of sense to simulate datasets. In this chapter we will simulate images of cells, membranes and nuclei and give examples for how those can help us better understanding what algorithms actually do.
