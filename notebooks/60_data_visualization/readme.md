# Data visualization

After feature measurements have been extracted, plotted and analysed using descriptive statistics, visualization of measurments in the coordinate system and space of the raw image can be helpful to better understand spatial organization of cells and tissues. In this chapter we will learn methods for visualizing measurements in the same space as our raw data, as overay and side-by-side.
